### One-command install (works anywhere TinyClaw runs — macOS, Linux, WSL, Docker, tmux)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/profbernardoj/tiny-everclaw/main/setup.sh | bash
```

Then:

```bash
tinyclaw start          # or tinyclaw restart
```

Your TinyClaw multi-agent teams instantly switch to **decentralized Morpheus inference** (GLM-5 heavy default, GLM-4.7-flash fast, Kimi K2.5, Qwen3-235b, etc.) via the local OpenAI-compatible proxy on `http://127.0.0.1:8083/v1`.

No rebuilds. No code changes. No API bills. Stake MOR once → unlimited use forever. TinyClaw’s <100 MB footprint, file-based queue, tmux 24/7, Discord/WhatsApp/Telegram channels, and live TUI visualizer stay 100% untouched.

### What’s in the repo (ready right now)

- `README.md` — full docs, multi-agent tips, model mapping, staking, troubleshooting
- `setup.sh` — installs EverClaw proxy + guardian into `~/.everclaw`, starts it as service (launchd/systemd), safely patches `~/.tinyclaw/settings.json` + adds env vars
- `settings.patch.json` — exact snippet merged into your global + per-agent configs
- `workspace/skills/enable-morpheus/` — TinyClaw skill (just drop in or run `/enable-morpheus` after setup)
- `tools-src/morpheus-status/` — optional CLI tool for status inside agents

### What setup.sh does automatically

1. Clones & installs the battle-tested EverClaw proxy + guardian (Node.js sidecar, ~80 MB total)
2. Starts proxy on boot (systemd user service or launchd)
3. Runs `tinyclaw start` wizard if needed
4. Adds these env vars (so Codex CLI automatically uses Morpheus):

```bash
export OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:8083/v1
export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-morpheus
```

5. Patches `~/.tinyclaw/settings.json` (backs up original) with Morpheus-ready agents:

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "coder": { "provider": "openai", "model": "glm-5" },
    "writer": { "provider": "openai", "model": "kimi-k2.5" },
    "reviewer": { "provider": "openai", "model": "glm-4.7-flash" }
  },
  "default_provider": "openai",
  "default_model": "glm-5"
}
```

6. Adds the `enable-morpheus` skill so you can say `/enable-morpheus` in any channel to toggle, check proxy health, or reconfigure teams

### Staking (unlimited use — same as all EverClaw forks)

```bash
cd ~/.everclaw
node scripts/everclaw-wallet.mjs setup
node scripts/everclaw-wallet.mjs stake   # stake MOR, never spend it
```

### Test it

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8083/health
tinyclaw status
tinyclaw team visualize dev
# In any channel: @coder hello using Morpheus
# or /enable-morpheus
```

### Why this is perfect for TinyClaw’s multi-team philosophy

- TinyClaw = lightweight Node.js + CLI wrappers (Codex CLI respects `OPENAI_BASE_URL` perfectly)
- EverClaw proxy = completely separate host process
- Together = still the tiniest multi-agent framework on the planet, now with **free decentralized inference**
- Full team collaboration, isolated workspaces, file queues, heartbeat, sender pairing, live TUI — all untouched
- Works with Discord/WhatsApp/Telegram, tmux daemon, parallel agents exactly as designed

Star the repo, run the setup, and your TinyClaw teams on any machine now have **unlimited GLM-5-class intelligence** with zero recurring cost and full autonomy.
